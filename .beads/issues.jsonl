Calls `config.ResolvePaths()` to get config file path + data directory\n2. Creates Docker API client via `docker.NewClient()`\n3. Calls `dc.StartCollector(ctx, configPath, dataPath)`\n4. StartCollector: pulls image → checks for existing container → ensures network → creates container with port bindings and volume mounts → starts container\n\n**`lotel stop`**:\n1. Creates Docker API client\n2. Calls `dc.StopCollector(ctx)`\n3. StopCollector: lists all containers → finds by name → stops (10s timeout) → removes container\n\n### Docker Coupling Points\n- `internal/docker/docker.go` (173 lines): All orchestration lives here\n  - Uses `github.com/docker/docker` client SDK directly\n  - Creates `telemetry-nest-network` bridge network\n  - Manages container named `telemetry-nest-otel-collector`\n  - Pulls `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest`\n  - Binds ports 4317, 4318, 13133, 8889\n  - Mounts config at `/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml`\n  - Mounts data at `/data` from `~/.lotel/data`\n  - Sets health check: `curl -f http://localhost:13133/`\n  - Restart policy: `unless-stopped`\n\n- `internal/config/config.go` (41 lines): Path resolution and constants\n  - `ImageName = \"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest\"`\n  - `ContainerName = \"telemetry-nest-otel-collector\"`\n  - `NetworkName = \"telemetry-nest-network\"`\n  - Config path: `{cwd}/docker/configs/otel/otel-collector-config.yaml`\n  - Data path: `~/.lotel/data/{traces,metrics,logs}`\n\n### Dependencies (go.mod)\n- `github.com/docker/docker v28.5.2` — Docker API client\n- `github.com/docker/go-connections v0.6.0` — NAT port bindings\n- These are the ONLY Docker-specific deps; removing them is straightforward\n\n### Migration Path to Subprocess Model\n1. Replace `internal/docker/` with `internal/process/` or `internal/collector/`\n2. Use `os/exec` to spawn `otelcol-contrib` binary as subprocess\n3. Store PID in `~/.lotel/state/collector.pid` for lifecycle management\n4. Config file can remain at same path or move to `~/.lotel/config/`\n5. Remove Docker deps from go.mod\n6. Add `status` command (not present today)\n7. Health check should use same HTTP endpoint: `http://localhost:13133/`\n\n### No Other Commands Exist\n- No `query`, `prune`, `status`, `health` commands today\n- The CLI is a thin wrapper around Docker container lifecycle\n- No state management beyond container existence","created_at":"2026-02-14T04:37:24Z"}]}
